# Contributing

## Overview

This document explains the processes and practices recommended for contributing
enhancements to
this operator.

- Generally, before developing bugs or enhancements to this charm, you
  should [open an issue
  ](https://github.com/canonical/glauth-k8s-operator/issues) explaining your use
  case.
- If you would like to chat with us about charm development, you can reach
  us
  at [Canonical Mattermost public channel](https://chat.charmhub.io/charmhub/channels/charm-dev)
  or [Discourse](https://discourse.charmhub.io/).
- Familiarising yourself with
  the [Charmed Operator Framework](https://juju.is/docs/sdk) library
  will help you a lot when working on new features or bug fixes.
- All enhancements require review before being merged. Code review typically
  examines
    - code quality
    - test coverage
    - user experience for Juju administrators of this charm.
- Please help us out in ensuring easy to review branches by rebasing your pull
  request branch onto
  the `main` branch. This also avoids merge commits and creates a linear Git
  commit history.

## Developing

You can use the environments created by `tox` for development:

```shell
tox --notest -e unit
source .tox/unit/bin/activate
```

## Testing

```shell
tox -e fmt           # update your code according to linting rules
tox -e lint          # code style
tox -e unit          # unit tests
tox -e integration   # integration tests
tox                  # runs 'fmt', 'lint', and 'unit' environments
```

## Build the charm

Build the charm using:

```shell
$ charmcraft pack
```

## Deploy the charm

```shell
# Create a juju model
juju add-model dev

# Enable DEBUG logging
juju model-config logging-config="<root>=INFO;unit=DEBUG"

# Deploy the charm
juju deploy ./glauth-k8s_ubuntu-*-amd64.charm --resource oci-image=$(yq eval '.resources.oci-image.upstream-source' metadata.yaml)
```

## Observability

The GLAuth charmed operator can integrate with
the [COS](https://charmhub.io/topics/canonical-observability-stack) to gather
and visualize telemetry signals generated by the charmed operator.

### Deploy COS-lite bundle

```shell
# Create a Juju model
$ juju add-model cos

# Switch to the created model
$ juju switch cos

# Deploy the cos-lite bundle
$ juju deploy cos-lite --trust

# Offer the endpoints in the cos-lite bundle
$ juju offer prometheus:metrics-endpoint
$ juju offer loki:logging
$ juju offer grafana:grafana-dashboard
```

### Integrate with COS-lite bundle

```shell
# Switch to the model where glauth-k8s lives
$ juju switch <juju-model>

# Integrate with the observability endpoints
$ juju integrate glauth-k8s admin/cos.prometheus
$ juju integrate glauth-k8s admin/cos.loki
$ juju integrate glauth-k8s admin/cos.grafana
```
